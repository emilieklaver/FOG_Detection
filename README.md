# FOG Detection
This is the respository for our paper titled Comparison of state of the art deep learning architectures for detection of freezing of gait in Parkinsonâ€™s disease , which is currently under review. We compared three different deep learning architectures; InceptionTime, MiniRocket and a CNN.

# Data
The data used in this project has retrieved by combining the work from Janssen et al. and Klaver et al.
